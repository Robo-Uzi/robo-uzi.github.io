## Among USniversity

**Category**: osint

**Description**: Bro, I found "Among Us" at this school! Can you spot the hidden acronym? Wrap it in v1t{...} to submit your answer. Example: University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City => v1t{UEH}.

I get this image:

I reverse image search and find the university quickly with almost the exact picture at [https://httt.uit.edu.vn/en_US/academic/](https://httt.uit.edu.vn/en_US/academic/). 

`v1t{UIT}`

## The Forgotten Inventory

**Category**: osint

**Description**: In the summer of 2007, a massive archive quietly surfaced — a meticulous ledger of items that once rolled across desert sands under foreign command. The file was structured, line after line, page after page, each entry tied to a unit whose banners flew far from home.

Someone wasn’t happy about its release. A message was sent, demanding its silence — a digital plea from a uniformed gatekeeper. The request was denied. Your task is to uncover **the sender of that plea.**

Clues hide in old public archives — look for a **tabular trail** documenting what was once called _Operation Freedom_, catalogued in a comma-separated vault of **1,996 pages** worth of equipment.

Some say the sands between two nations hold the real context — where east met west, and war turned into a spreadsheet. Find the **email address** of the _official_ who tried to bury the list.    Format: `v1t{hello.hi@ehatever.com}`. 

The challenge author says "Operation Freedom" which I assume is Operation Iraqi Freedom. After some searching for any document I could find related which was also 1,996 pages, I found one on wikileaks at [https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Iraq_OIF_Property_List](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Iraq_OIF_Property_List). 

On the page it says:
```shell
**Summary**

All US Army managed military equipment in Iraq ("Operation Iraqi Freedom") 
as recorded by US battle planning systems. The list is broken down by Military Unit. 
1,996 pages at 50 lines per page. This is a browseable directory of html files 
linked to military logistics databases.
```

Ok interesting. At the bottom I see the file is in fact unclassified (plus its from 2007) and also a link to the original document:
```shell
**Description (as provided by our source)**  

For Official Use Only (unclassified). This version was generated by 
[US Military Equipment/cvs2html.py](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/US_Military_Equipment/cvs2html.py 
"US Military Equipment/cvs2html.py"). The original leaked document can be found 
at [Iraq OIF Property List.csv](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Iraq_OIF_Property_List.csv "Iraq OIF Property List.csv").
```

When clicking on the link ([https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Iraq_OIF_Property_List.csv](https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Iraq_OIF_Property_List.csv)) for the original document I find a note which contains what I'm looking for:
```shell
**Note**  

The United States military (FORSCOM) has requested part of the material (which concerns the requestors) 
to be removed and has asked for the sources details. The requests were denied. Wikileaks does not 
collect source identifying information.

## 16th Duck

**Category**: osint

**Description**: Caught someone playing music at this place and here are their belongings, can you find the place? Flag format: v1t{latitude, longitude}. Example: v1t{36.123456,18.789123}.

I get two images. Image one:

Image two:

I reverse image search the medals and find an exact match at [https://auction.ru/offer/krasnoznamennaja_vojskovaja_chast_v_ch_61608_100_let_svjaz_kosmos-i109496963498623.html#1](https://auction.ru/offer/krasnoznamennaja_vojskovaja_chast_v_ch_61608_100_let_svjaz_kosmos-i109496963498623.html#1) selling the medal very recently.

The listing describes: `Red Banner Military Unit 61608 - 100 Years (Communication) Space`.

So the medals belong to `Military Unit 61608` which I look up. The unit is also known as the 16th Center of the FSB which inherited the primary signals intelligence (SIGINT)
capabilities from the Soviet KGB. It is a SIGINT site located south of Tsaritsyno Park, in a densely forested area in the heart of Moscow.

I found a PDF detailing the units capabilities here: [https://checkfirst.network/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OSINT_Phaleristics_Unveiling_FSB_16th_Center_SIGINT_Capabilities.pdf](https://checkfirst.network/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OSINT_Phaleristics_Unveiling_FSB_16th_Center_SIGINT_Capabilities.pdf).
