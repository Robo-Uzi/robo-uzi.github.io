**Title:** horse-drawn

**Category:** Misc

**Author**: [virchau13](https://github.com/virchau13)

**Description:** This is how it must have felt in the Year of Our Ford.

`ssh hexed@challs.watctf.org -p 8022`

I get this python file:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3  
import sys  
assert sys.stdout.isatty()  
flag = open("/flag.txt").read().strip()  
to_print = flag + '\r' + ('lmao no flag for you ' * 32)  
print(to_print)
```
`assert sys.stdout.isatty()` means `stdout` must be a terminal. `\r` moves the cursor back to the start of the same line without advancing down, so `flag + '\r' + ('lmao no flag for you ' * 32)` overwrites the flag text on screen visually.

This is what I get when connecting:
```shell
ssh hexed@challs.watctf.org -p 8022  
The authenticity of host '[challs.watctf.org]:8022 ([172.174.211.227]:8022)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

```

In the raw output the flag still comes before the `\r`. Capture it with `sed -n 'l'` which prints all characters literally. `ssh -tt` forces a psuedo terminal. 
```shell
sshpass -p '' ssh -tt -p 8022 hexed@challs.watctf.org 2>/dev/null | sed -n 'l'
