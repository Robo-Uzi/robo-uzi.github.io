**Title:** Tribble with my Skin

**Category:** misc

**Author:** oatzs

**Description:** My Minecraft account got hacked and now my skin seems to be a little off...

Might be having trouble with the tribbles...

Mind checking it out? My Minecraft username is "oatzs".

PS: A Minecraft account/instance is not required for this challenge. The most recently used skin is the suspicious one.

I go to [https://skinmc.net/skins/b8a5a1d7-c0c6-4c2c-98bb-253d16be05f4](https://skinmc.net/skins/b8a5a1d7-c0c6-4c2c-98bb-253d16be05f4) and download the latest skin for this account. I scaled up the image:
